# Project of Data Visualization Group 17

The city of Madrid is one of the cities that concentrates a large and varied listing of short-term Airbnb rentals, and we are interested in analysing the data related to it. With the development of this visual analytics app, we intend to generate a system that helps an analyst to face the analysis of the problem generated by Airbnb in the cities and therefore gain new knowledge in order to make any conclusion of how the app is really being used in the city.

By using the public available data of the listings of Airbnb in the city of Madrid, we intend to answer some questions:
- How are the different offers distributed across the city?
- Do we find differences between the different neighbourhoods/districts in the city?
- Is there any variation in the offers across time? Seasonality found?
- What can be learnt about the different hosts? (Their number of listings , since when they are host, superhost or not
